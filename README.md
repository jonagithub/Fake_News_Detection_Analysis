# Fake_News_Detection_Analysis
# Completed Fake News Detection Analysis using LSTM from kaggle dataset
- Performed data loading and preprocessing
  - Removed unnecessary columns (id,title,author), Created new column ‘clean_news’ for cleaned text data
- Text data cleaning
  - Converted text to lowercase, removed non-alphanumeric characters, newlines, and extra spaces, and removed stop words
- Text analysis and visualization
  - Word cloud visualization to visualize frequent words in the entire dataset and in genuine and fake news separately
- Text Tokenization and Sequence Creation
  - Tokenize the cleaned text data
  - Created sequences from the tokenized text for use in the model
- Word Ebedding setup
  - Load pre-trained word embeddings (GloVe) from a file
  - Created an embedding index (a dictionary) to map words to their corresponding word vectors
- Created Embedding Matrix
  - Initialized and embedded matrix with zeros
  - Populate the embedding matrix with pre-trained word vectors for words in the vocabulary
- Model Definition and Training
  - Defined a neural network model with an embedding layer, LSTM and dense layers
  -   Compiled the model with binary cross-entropy loss and ‘adam’ optimizer
  - Trained the model on the cleaned andtokenized data with pre-trained embeddings
  - Monitored and visualized the training process using accuracy and loss plots
